===========================================================

Welcome! This guide walks you step by step through using the C# 
Compression App.

You will learn how to select files, use buttons, view animated
explanations,and save your compressed or decompressed results
with confidence.

-------------------------------------------------------
LOADING A FILE
-----------------------------------------------------------
To get started, choose one of these:

1) BROWSE...
   - Press the "Browse..." button.

   - Select a regular text file (ASCII .txt works best) from
your computer.

   - The filename will appear in the app after selection.

2) TRY A DEMO
   - Use the "Small Demo" or "Large Demo" buttons to load a
built-in example.

   - If you click a demo button, the app will automatically
begin compression.


-----------------------------------------------------------
COMPRESSING A FILE
-----------------------------------------------------------
FOR YOUR OWN FILE:

1. PRESS "COMPRESS"
   - After selecting a file with "Browse...", click "Compress"
to begin.

2. WATCH THE ANIMATION AND NARRATION
   - The app visually shows what happens behind the scenes:
     * Character frequency table is built.
     * The Huffman tree appears, growing as nodes combine.
     * You’ll see binary codes assigned to each character.
  
- Narration in the right panel explains every step. 

3. STEP THROUGH EACH PHASE
   - Press "Next" to advance through animation and narration
steps.
   - Use "Previous" to revisit earlier steps.

- IMPORTANT: Wait for each animation to finish before pressing
"Next" or "Previous" again.

4. WHEN COMPRESSION IS DONE
   - The app shows a summary of:
       * Original vs. compressed size
       * Compression ratio
       * Location of your compressed file (Compressed.bin)
   - Use "Next" for more details on output data.


-----------------------------------------------------------
DECOMPRESSING A FILE
-----------------------------------------------------------
- After compressing, click "Decompress" at any time.
  (This also works if you select an existing compressed file.)

- The decompressed result will be saved as Decompressed.txt,
alongside the compressed file.

- The app will visualize how your original file is restored,
with narration and animations.

- You can step forward and backward with "Next" and "Previous".
  (Let each animation finish before clicking again.)


-----------------------------------------------------------
BUTTON GUIDE
-----------------------------------------------------------
BUTTON       | FUNCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------
BROWSE...    | Select a text file from your computer

SMALL DEMO   | Loads a small example file and compresses it

LARGE DEMO   | Loads a large demo file and compresses it

COMPRESS     | Starts compressing your loaded file

DECOMPRESS   | Restores from Compressed.bin to Decompressed.txt

NEXT         | Advances to the next animation/narration step

PREVIOUS     | Goes back to the previous step


-----------------------------------------------------------
HELPFUL TIPS
-----------------------------------------------------------
- FULL SCREEN: If animations are too large, maximize the window
for a better view.

- FOLLOW ON-SCREEN INSTRUCTIONS: The right panel provides easy-
to-read guidance.

- DON’T RUSH: Wait for each animation to complete before
clicking again.

- FILE NAMES: Compressed and decompressed files are
automatically saved as Compressed.bin and Decompressed.txt in
the app's folder.


-----------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING
-----------------------------------------------------------
- STRANGE CHARACTERS IN PREVIEW: Non-printable (control)
characters may appear; this is normal for technical data.

- APP SAYS “NOT AN ASCII FILE”: Use a plain .txt file instead of
a Word document or PDF.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for using the C# Compression App!
Enjoy learning and exploring at your own pace.
